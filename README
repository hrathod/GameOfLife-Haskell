A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Haskell.
Tested with GHC on Linux.  To compile, run

ghc -o gol Main.hs

To run the game, provide the width, height, and the initial living cells:

./gol 6 6 "[(2,2),(3,2),(2,3),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5)]"

Notice that the living cells are quoted.  Feedback welcome.
